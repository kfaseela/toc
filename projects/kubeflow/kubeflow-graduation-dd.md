## Graduation Evaluation Summary for Kubeflow

### Criteria Evaluation

Faseela K and Brandt Keller conducted the due diligence for Kubeflow, which applied for Graduation from Incubating status (accepted 2023-07-23).

The following criteria implementations are noteworthy:

- [Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) is a modular, Kubernetes-native AI/ML platform. This graduation covers **6 subprojects**: Kubeflow Trainer, Kubeflow Pipelines, Kubeflow Katib, Kubeflow Notebooks, Kubeflow Spark Operator, and Kubeflow Hub.
- Governance is shared across the KSC, KOC, KDC, and the Working Groups that own each subproject, with the 2026 KSC election completed on schedule and representation rules holding.
- The Kubeflow maintainers and community were highly responsive throughout this review, with PRs merged, issues filed and assigned, and feedback addressed quickly.
- All graduation subprojects hold at least an OpenSSF Best Practices Passing badge; Kubeflow Trainer and Kubeflow Katib have achieved Gold.
- The Kubeflow Ecosystem page and process were established during this review to clarify the boundary between core subprojects and ecosystem partners such as KServe, Feast, and Elyra.
- Kubeflow shows broad adoption across research, financial services, logistics, and platform teams. Four adopter interviews were conducted across the graduation scope.
- Contributor health remains strong, with active contributors from a wide range of organizations and positive YoY growth.

DD Findings Resolved (Blocking/Required):

- **[kubeflow/community#992](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/992) - Third-party security audit findings**: Ada Logics audit is published; findings are resolved or tracked. KServe findings are out of scope (independent CNCF project).
- **[kubeflow/community#972](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/972) - WG contributor progression docs**: WG Chair requirements and responsibilities documented in [community#989](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/989).
- **[kubeflow/community#988](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/988) - Roadmap gaps**: notebooks ROADMAP added; kubeflow/kubeflow and website subproject roadmap references updated.
- **[kubeflow/community#990](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/990) - Notebooks release process docs**: `RELEASE.md` added in notebooks and linked to detailed release docs.
- **[kubeflow/community#955](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/955) - KSC vendor-neutrality and election status**: 2026 election results published and org-limit language consolidated.
- **[kubeflow/community#961](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/961)/[community#962](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/962) - KServe ecosystem categorization**: ecosystem boundary clarified via [community#963](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/963), [website#4384](https://github.com/kubeflow/website/pull/4384), [community#965](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/965).

Non-Blocking Recommendations Completed:

- **[kubeflow/community#964](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/964) - GTR snapshot submission**: completed via [toc#2180](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/2180).
- **[kubeflow/community#996](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/996) - Security self-assessment submission**: completed via [toc#2201](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/2201).
- **[kubeflow/community#976](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/976) - Add `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` files to subproject repos**: All graduation subproject repos now have `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- **[kubeflow/community#991](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/991) - Security self-assessment enhancements**: Broken Trainer release link fixed and stale vulnerability-status wording updated via [Fix self-assessment links and stale wording (community#996)](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/996).
- **Community/ADOPTERS.md listed KServe in the "Adopters of Kubeflow Projects" table**: KServe removed from the subprojects adopters table; only the 6 graduation subprojects are listed.
- **[kubeflow/community#967](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/967)/[community#969](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/969) - WG docs ownership and stale links**: outdated WGs removed and WG docs/link updates merged across community and website.

Adopter Interview Feedback (Non-Blocking, Ongoing):

- **Helm chart for installation**: deployment ergonomics remain a common request. Trainer and Spark Operator already provide Helm charts, and community-distribution Helm work is in progress.
- **Service manager / operator documentation**: Upstream docs are adequate for end users but insufficient for operators managing multi-tenant production deployments.
- **Security: inference endpoint multi-tenancy**: Cross-namespace authorization issue in KServe/Knative - upstream: [Cross-namespace inference endpoint auth issue (knative/serving#12533)](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/12533).
- **Pipeline artifact multi-tenancy**: [Pipeline artifact multi-tenancy (pipelines#11760)](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/issues/11760).
- **MLMD component maintenance**: MLMD is no longer actively maintained and depends on deprecated `mysql_native_password` auth, blocking MySQL backend upgrades.
- **Security CVE response across interconnected components**: CVE in a dependency (e.g., KServe) can block the entire platform; a security best practices document for operators was requested.
- **More frequent releases / faster security patching**: Current release cadence can be too slow for regulated environments with aggressive patching requirements.
- **Maintainer growth, particularly for Pipelines**: Long-term sustainability risk noted; growing the maintainer base across subprojects is an active priority.
- **UX for non-engineer users**: A simplified UX for data scientists and business analysts with no Kubernetes background would broaden adoption.

### Adoption Evaluation

Adopter feedback for Kubeflow satisfies the TOC's adoption requirements for Graduation. Public ADOPTERS.md evidence across the graduation-scope subprojects, together with four completed adopter interviews, shows sustained production use in enterprise and research environments.

The interviews consistently point to lifecycle coverage, Kubernetes-native architecture, multi-cloud flexibility, and active maintainer engagement.

Adopter-requested enhancements are already captured in the previous section and are tracked as non-blocking follow-up items.

### Final Assessment

The TOC has found the project to have satisfied the criteria for Graduation.

Based on the evidence in this DD, Kubeflow is ready for Graduation.

The remaining items identified in this DD are non-blocking and should be tracked through the project's public roadmap and follow-up execution, with continued visibility to the TOC.

## Criteria

## Application Process Principles

### Suggested

N/A

### Required

- [X] **Give a presentation and engage with the domain specific TAG(s) to increase awareness.**

Kubeflow has presented to TAG Runtime twice:
- TAG Runtime - January 2021: [https://youtu.be/S6N8ARZZcGs](https://youtu.be/S6N8ARZZcGs)
- TAG Runtime and TOC AI Initiatives - November 2024: [https://youtu.be/u4Mf3Jh8v2E?t=2243](https://youtu.be/u4Mf3Jh8v2E?t=2243)

The November 2024 presentation covered project overview, 2024 highlights, a live fine-tuning demo, and named graduation as a 2025/2026 goal. No concerns or action items were raised by TAG Runtime.

- [X] **TAG provides insight/recommendation of the project in the context of the landscape.**

TAG Runtime provided a positive recommendation for Kubeflow's graduation readiness based on the November 2024 presentation ([https://youtu.be/u4Mf3Jh8v2E?t=2243](https://youtu.be/u4Mf3Jh8v2E?t=2243)) and review of the application materials.

- [X] **All project metadata and resources are [vendor-neutral](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/).**

The KSC charter enforces a maximum of 1 seat per organization across all 5 KSC seats. Current KSC composition (verified 2026-06-11): Andrey Velichkevich (Apple), Chase Christensen (Wiz), Francisco Arceo (Red Hat), Julius von Kohout (DHL), Mathew Wicks (NVIDIA) - 5 seats, 5 unique organizations. The KOC (Outreach Committee) similarly enforces a maximum of 1 Chair per org. The 2026 election completed on schedule ([2026 KSC election issue (community#950)](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/950)) with the previous Red Hat dual-seat and stale KEP language concerns resolved via [Add 2026 KSC election results (community#956)](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/956) and [Consolidate KSC org-limit rule (community#957)](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/957).

- [X] **Review and acknowledgement of expectations for sandbox projects and requirements for moving forward through the CNCF Maturity levels.**
  - [X] Acknowledged in the graduation application body (September 2025) per CNCF application requirements.

Completion of this due diligence document, resolution of concerns raised, and presentation for public comment satisfies the Due Diligence Review criterion.

- [X] **Additional documentation as appropriate for project type, e.g.: installation documentation, end user documentation, reference implementation and/or code samples.**

All 6 graduation subprojects have dedicated documentation pages on kubeflow.org with installation guides, user guides, operator guides, and reference documentation. The [kubeflow.org docs site](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/) is actively maintained. The [General Technical Review](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/KUBEFLOW-GENERAL-TECHNICAL-REVIEW.md) (GTR) provides an extensive technical reference. Kubeflow Notebooks has an architectural dependency on Kubeflow Central Dashboard and cannot yet be deployed standalone - this is however a part of their roadmap.

## Governance and Maintainers

### Suggested

- [X] **Governance has continuously been iterated upon by the project as a result of their experience applying it, with the governance history demonstrating evolution of maturity alongside the project's maturity evolution.**

The Kubeflow governance model has evolved alongside the project: from a single Google-donated project to a multi-org structure with the KSC, KOC, KDC, formal WG lifecycle docs, KEPs, and a subproject application process. The history of governance PRs in kubeflow/community demonstrates ongoing iteration.

### Required

- [X] **Clear and discoverable project governance documentation.**

The kubeflow.org [governance page](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/governance/) is the public governance root. In the community repo, governance is documented in the KSC, KOC, and KDC charters, WG governance, and the contributor ladder ([KSC charter](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/committee-steering/charter.md), [KOC charter](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/committee-outreach/charter.md), [KDC charter](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/committee-distribution/charter.md), [wg-governance](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/committee-steering/wg-governance.md), [community-membership](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/community-membership.md)).

- [X] **Governance is up to date with actual project activities, including any meetings, elections, leadership, or approval processes.**

KSC elections and membership are current (2026 election completed). WG governance docs were refreshed to remove defunct WGs and update current meetings, organizers, and links via [community#974](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/974), [community#989](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/989), [community#997](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/997), and [website#4398](https://github.com/kubeflow/website/pull/4398).

- [X] **Governance clearly documents [vendor-neutral](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/community/vendor-neutrality/) of project direction.**

The KSC charter documents an explicit 1-seat-per-organization cap for its seats, and the KOC charter similarly caps Chair representation. This keeps governance structurally vendor-neutral even with some technical concentration in contributor activity; the 2026 KSC election confirmed the rule in practice.

- [X] **Document how the project makes decisions on leadership, contribution acceptance, requests to the CNCF, and changes to governance or project goals.**

Decision-making is documented across KSC decisions, the KEP process, and the ecosystem join process for external project partnerships ([committee-steering/charter.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/committee-steering/charter.md), [proposals](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/tree/master/proposals), [ecosystem](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/tree/master/ecosystem)).

- [X] **Document how role, function-based members, or sub-teams are assigned, onboarded, and removed for specific teams (example: Security Response Committee).**

The [Kubeflow community page](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/community/) and [Contributing](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/contributing/) page provide the public entry point, while the contributor ladder and WG governance document how Members, Reviewers, Approvers, and WG Chairs are onboarded, expected to contribute, and removed when inactive. The WG chair requirements were clarified in [community#989](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/989).

- [X] **Document complete list of current maintainers, including names, contact information, domain of responsibility, and affiliation.**

[MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md) links to the KSC member list, KOC member list, WG chairs/leads in `wgs.yaml`, and per-subproject OWNERS files. The KSC and KOC lists include names, GitHub handles, organizations, and terms; `wgs.yaml` was refreshed alongside [community#974](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/974).

- [X] **A number of active maintainers which is appropriate to the size and scope of the project.**

[MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md) covers governance-level maintainers (KSC and KOC) and links to per-subproject OWNERS files for approver-level maintainers. All 6 graduation subprojects have active approvers listed in their respective OWNERS files. The maintainer count is appropriate for a project of Kubeflow's size and scope.

- [X] **Document a complete maintainer lifecycle process (including roles, onboarding, offboarding, and emeritus status).**

The [contributor ladder](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/community-membership.md) defines the full lifecycle: onboarding criteria for each role (Member -> Reviewer -> Approver), offboarding (12-month inactivity -> org removal; `emeritus_approvers` for inactive approvers), and WG Lead/Chair removal via super-majority vote.

- [X] **Demonstrate usage of the maintainer lifecycle with outcomes, either through the addition or replacement of maintainers as project events have required.**

Addition examples (all verified merged 2025-2026):
- [Add @mprahl and @zazulam as KFP maintainers (pipelines#12059)](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/pull/12059) - Added @mprahl + @zazulam as KFP maintainers with community announcement
- [Add @Electronic-Waste as approver, @astefanutti as reviewer (trainer#2659)](https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer/pull/2659) - Added with explicit criteria verification against the membership page
- [Add @Al-Pragliola as approver (hub#1153)](https://github.com/kubeflow/hub/pull/1153) - Added with full checklist verification and linked internal-acls PR

Removal example:
- [@zw0610 moves to emeritus_approvers (trainer#2343)](https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer/pull/2343) - @zw0610 self-removed to `emeritus_approvers`

- [X] **Project maintainers from at least 2 organizations that demonstrates survivability.**

Maintainer org diversity is broad across all graduation subprojects, with approvers spanning a wide range of organizations ([LFX Insights](https://insights.lfx.dev/foundation/cncf/overview/github?project=kubeflow)). Org affiliation for governance-level maintainers is documented in the KSC and KOC member lists linked from [MAINTAINERS.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md), and for WG leads/chairs in [wgs.yaml](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/wgs.yaml). No subproject is controlled by a single organization. WG Notebooks leadership was updated in [Update WG Notebooks docs (community#983)](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/983), to replace an inactive lead and ensure organizational diversity.

- [X] **Code and Doc ownership in Github and elsewhere matches documented governance roles.**

Kubeflow uses a GitOps ACL system ([kubeflow/internal-acls](https://github.com/kubeflow/internal-acls)) via Peribolos and Prow: org membership, team membership, and repo permissions are declared in `github-orgs/kubeflow/org.yaml` and reconciled against GitHub. The KSC team, WG lead teams, and security-team are declared in org.yaml and match governance documents. Per-repo code ownership is enforced via OWNERS files (Prow `lgtm` + `approve`). `default_repository_permission: read` enforces least privilege.

- [X] **Document agreement that project will adopt CNCF Code of Conduct.**

The CNCF Code of Conduct is adopted and documented at [kubeflow.org/docs/about/community/#code-of-conduct](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/community/#code-of-conduct), and cross-linked from committee charters and WG governance docs.

- [X] **CNCF Code of Conduct is cross-linked from other governance documents.**

The CNCF CoC is referenced in WG governance docs and individual WG/committee charters. As of 2026-06-18, standalone `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` files are present in all 7 graduation subproject repos: community, spark-operator, trainer, katib, notebooks, hub, and pipelines. Resolved via [kubeflow/community#976](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/976).

- [X] **All subprojects, if any, are listed.**

The 6 graduation subprojects are listed consistently across the graduation application, GTR, kubeflow.org architecture page, `wgs.yaml`, and `internal-acls/org.yaml`:
1. Kubeflow Trainer - [kubeflow/trainer](https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer)
2. Kubeflow Pipelines - [kubeflow/pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines)
3. Kubeflow Katib - [kubeflow/katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib)
4. Kubeflow Notebooks - [kubeflow/notebooks](https://github.com/kubeflow/notebooks)
5. Kubeflow Spark Operator - [kubeflow/spark-operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/spark-operator)
6. Kubeflow Hub - [kubeflow/hub](https://github.com/kubeflow/hub)

The subproject add/remove process is documented in [community/subprojects/README.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/tree/master/subprojects) and is directly linked from the [kubeflow.org introduction page](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/introduction/#kubeflow-subprojects).

- [X] **If the project has subprojects: subproject leadership, contribution, maturity status documented, including add/remove process.**

**Add process:** Documented in [community/subprojects/README.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/tree/master/subprojects): GitHub issue -> proposal doc -> community call demo -> PR -> KSC vote -> repo transfer. Prior applications (spark-operator, model-registry) are archived there.

**Remove/retire process:** Documented in [WG lifecycle](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/committee-steering/wg-governance.md#wg-lifecycle): WG retirement triggers (3 months without quorum -> should retire; 6 months -> must retire), archiving steps, and KSC final vote.

**Contribution docs:** All 6 subprojects have `CONTRIBUTING.md` files (verified 2026-06-16).

**Maturity/roadmap:** All 6 subprojects have `ROADMAP.md`. Subproject maturity levels are being introduced via [Add subproject maturity levels (community#965)](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/965).

## Contributors and Community

### Suggested

- [X] **Contributor ladder with multiple roles for contributors.**

The [contributor ladder](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/community-membership.md) defines 4 levels: Member -> Reviewer -> Approver -> WG Lead/Chair, each with documented requirements, responsibilities, and privileges. Onboarding and offboarding at each step are described.

### Required

- [X] **Clearly defined and discoverable process to submit issues or changes.**

Issue submission guidance is at [kubeflow.org/docs/about/contributing/#starter-issues](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/contributing/#starter-issues). Change proposals follow the [KEP process](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/tree/master/proposals) with a documented lifecycle (provisional -> implementable -> implemented) and PR template.

- [X] **Project must have, and document, at least one public communications channel for users and/or contributors.**

Kubeflow uses CNCF Slack with dedicated subproject channels. Channels and entry points are documented at [kubeflow.org/docs/about/community/#slack-channels](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/community/#slack-channels). The [kubeflow-discuss mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/kubeflow-discuss) is also documented.

- [X] **List and document all project communication channels, including subprojects (mail list/slack/etc.). List any non-public communications channels and what their special purpose is.**

The [community page](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/community/) lists all public channels: CNCF Slack channels, kubeflow-discuss mailing list, YouTube channels, social media, and community meetings calendar. The non-public channel (KSC private mailing list: `ksc@kubeflow.org`) is documented with its purpose (private KSC deliberation and security escalation).

- [X] **Up-to-date public meeting schedulers and/or integration with CNCF calendar.**

Community-level meeting calendar is published and integrated with CNCF/LFX calendar at [kubeflow.org/docs/about/community/#list-of-available-meetings](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/community/#list-of-available-meetings). WG-level meeting metadata was refreshed via [WG docs need to reflect current subproject ownership (community#967)](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/967) and [WG README files have stale and broken links (community#969)](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/969) - broken Zoom/calendar links, stale Slack workspace references, and stale organizer handles updated across all active WGs.

- [X] **Documentation of how to contribute, with increasing detail as the project matures.**

Central contributing guide at [kubeflow.org/docs/about/contributing/](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/about/contributing/). All 6 graduation subprojects have `CONTRIBUTING.md` files in their repos with subproject-specific contribution guidance (verified 2026-06-17).

- [X] **Demonstrate contributor activity and recruitment.**

LF Insights shows strong contributor activity across a wide range of organizations, with positive YoY growth and healthy contributor retention. Recent maintainer additions across multiple subprojects demonstrate active recruitment (trainer#2659, pipelines#12059, hub#1153).

## Engineering Principles

### Suggested

N/A

### Required

- [X] **Document project goals and objectives that illustrate the project's differentiation in the Cloud Native landscape as well as outlines how this project fulfills an outstanding need and/or solves a problem differently.**

Addressed by the [GTR](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/KUBEFLOW-GENERAL-TECHNICAL-REVIEW.md) (lines 13-152): Kubeflow is positioned as a "foundation of tools for AI Platforms on Kubernetes," differentiated by its composability, modularity, Kubernetes-native design, and support for the full ML lifecycle. Target personas (data scientists, ML engineers, platform engineers, vendors) and primary use cases (distributed training, fine-tuning, HPO, pipelines, serving) are explicitly documented, along with unsupported use cases (no GitOps implementation, no infrastructure beyond Kubernetes).

- [X] **Document what the project does, and why it does it - including viable cloud native use cases.**

Addressed by the [GTR](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/KUBEFLOW-GENERAL-TECHNICAL-REVIEW.md) (lines 82-152): primary use cases include large-scale data processing, distributed pre-training of foundation models, LLM fine-tuning, hyperparameter optimization, end-to-end GenAI pipelines, interactive AI development, and multi-tenancy. The [kubeflow.org architecture page](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/architecture/) with the AI lifecycle diagram provides the user-facing project overview.

- [X] **Document and maintain a public roadmap or other forward looking planning document or tracking mechanism.**

All 6 graduation subprojects now have `ROADMAP.md` files. `kubeflow/notebooks` ROADMAP.md was added via [Add ROADMAP.md to notebooks (notebooks#1188)](https://github.com/kubeflow/notebooks/pull/1188). Resolved via [kubeflow/community#988](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/988).

- [X] **Roadmap change process is documented.**

Community-wide changes use the [KEP process](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/tree/master/proposals) (proposal -> community review -> implementation). Subproject-specific proposals are managed in subproject KEP directories (e.g., [trainer/docs/proposals](https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer/tree/master/docs/proposals)). The full KEP lifecycle (provisional -> implementable -> implemented) and template are documented.

- [X] **Document overview of project architecture and software design that demonstrates viable cloud native use cases, as part of the project's documentation.**

Architecture documentation is detailed: the [GTR](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/KUBEFLOW-GENERAL-TECHNICAL-REVIEW.md) covers design principles, architecture requirements, service dependencies, IAM design, API topology, and release process. The [kubeflow.org architecture page](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/architecture/) includes an AI lifecycle diagram and component descriptions. The [Kubeflow Community Distribution release pages](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/kubeflow-distribution/releases/) provide per-release component version matrices.

- [x] **Document the project's release process and guidelines publicly in a RELEASES.md or equivalent file that defines:**
  - [X] Release expectations (scheduled or based on feature implementation)
  - [X] Tagging as stable, unstable, and security related releases
  - [X] Information on branch and tag strategies
  - [X] Branch and platform support and length of support
  - [X] Artifacts included in the release.

All 6 graduation subprojects have `RELEASE.md` or equivalent. `kubeflow/notebooks` `RELEASE.md` was added via [Add RELEASE.md to notebooks (notebooks#1189)](https://github.com/kubeflow/notebooks/pull/1189); it points to detailed step-by-step release docs (minor/patch/RC/GA, signed tagging, artifact updates) in `releasing/README.md` on both `notebooks-v1` and `notebooks-v2` branches. Resolved via [kubeflow/community#990](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/990).

- [X] **History of regular, quality releases.**

All 6 graduation subprojects have consistent release histories (verified 2026-06-17):
- Trainer: v2.2.1 (2026-06-17), v2.2.0 (2026-03-19), v2.1.0 (2025-11-07)
- Pipelines: 2.16.1 (2026-05-04), 2.16.0 (2026-02-25), 2.15.x (2025-11/12)
- Spark Operator: v2.5.1 (2026-06-14), v2.5.0 (2026-03-19), v2.4.0 (2025-11-17)
- Katib: v0.19.0 (2025-10-30), v0.18.0 (2025-03-25), v0.17.0 (2024-07-12)
- Hub: v0.3.10 (2026-06-15), v0.3.9 (2026-05-04), v0.3.8 (2026-04-03)
- Notebooks: v1.11.0 (2026-06-04) + active v2.0.0-alpha line (2026 Q2)

RC/pre-release tags are used before stable releases, and patch releases are present across subprojects, indicating quality-focused release practices. The [Kubeflow Community Distribution release history](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/kubeflow-distribution/releases/) spans from v0.6 through the current 26.03 release with detailed per-release notes.

## Security

### Suggested

- [ ] **Achieving OpenSSF Best Practices silver or gold badge.**

[Trainer](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/10435) and [Katib](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/9941) have achieved Gold.

### Required

- [X] **Clearly defined and discoverable process to report security issues.**

All 6 graduation subprojects have `SECURITY.md` files documenting: supported versions, private vulnerability reporting via GitHub Security Advisories, escalation to `ksc@kubeflow.org`, a disclosure process (acknowledgment within 10 business days, assessment, resolution, public disclosure), and explicit guidance not to use public channels. Verified across kubeflow/trainer, pipelines, katib, notebooks, spark-operator, and hub (2026-06-17).

- [X] **Enforcing Access Control Rules to secure the code base against attacks (Example: two factor authentication enforcement, and/or use of ACL tools.)**

Kubeflow uses a GitOps ACL system via [kubeflow/internal-acls](https://github.com/kubeflow/internal-acls): org membership and repo permissions are declared in `github-orgs/kubeflow/org.yaml` and reconciled by Peribolos. 2FA is required for all GitHub org members. `default_repository_permission: read` enforces least privilege.

- [X] **Document assignment of security response roles and how reports are handled.**

Security response roles are documented in each subproject's security policy: reports handled by project owners, with KSC (`ksc@kubeflow.org`) as escalation. A dedicated `security-team` is declared in `internal-acls/org.yaml`. Disclosure process (acknowledgment, investigation, resolution, public disclosure) is documented consistently across all 6 subproject policies.

- [X] **Document Security Self-Assessment.**

The [Kubeflow Security Self-Assessment](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/security/self-assessment.md) is published in kubeflow/community, actively maintained (updated 2026), and covers all 6 graduation subprojects. Content structure follows TAG Security guidance including metadata, security links, background, actors, goals, security functions, secure development practices, and security issue resolution. The self-assessment is also merged into cncf/toc via [Kubeflow Security Self-Assessment (toc#2201)](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/2201) and is currently located in this DD folder at [security-assessment/self-assessment.md](security-assessment/self-assessment.md).

- [X] **Third Party Security Review.**
  - [X] Moderate and low findings from the Third Party Security Review are planned/tracked for resolution.

The Ada Logics security audit (Sept 2025) is publicly available: [security/Ada_Logics-Kubeflow-security-audit-2025.pdf](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/security/Ada_Logics-Kubeflow-security-audit-2025.pdf), published via [Publish Ada Logics security audit (community#994)](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/pull/994). All in-scope findings are resolved or tracked with linked PRs/issues; KServe findings are out of scope as KServe is an independent CNCF project. Full tracking details are in [kubeflow/community#992](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/issues/992).

### Required

- [X] **Publicly documented list of adopters, which may indicate their adoption level (dev/trialing, prod, etc.)**

All 6 graduation subprojects maintain public `ADOPTERS.md` files:
- [community/ADOPTERS.md](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md): 7 platform adopters (AT&T, CERN, DHL, Jio, Slalom, Telia, RAICS.AI)
- [Spark Operator](https://github.com/kubeflow/spark-operator/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md): 40+ adopters, many in Production
- [Trainer](https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md): ~20 adopters (AWS, Cisco, NVIDIA, Bloomberg, Red Hat, etc.)
- [Katib](https://github.com/kubeflow/katib/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md): ~12 adopters
- [Kubeflow Hub](https://github.com/kubeflow/hub/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md): 5 adopters
- [Pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md): 4 adopters sparse for the most widely deployed subproject
- [Notebooks](https://github.com/kubeflow/notebooks/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md): 1 adopter (Red Hat only) very thin - CERN addition in progress: [Add CERN to Notebooks ADOPTERS.md (notebooks#1190)](https://github.com/kubeflow/notebooks/pull/1190)

Notebooks and Pipelines ADOPTERS.md files are sparse relative to actual deployment scale. Adopter interview evidence provides independent validation.

- [ ] **Used in appropriate capacity by at least 3 independent + indirect/direct adopters, (these are not required to be in the publicly documented list of adopters)**

> **Status: In Progress - interviews completed, TOC verification pending.**

All 4 planned adopter interviews have been completed. Based on public ADOPTERS.md evidence alone (Spark Operator 40+, Trainer ~20, platform 7), broad production adoption is clearly evidenced in aggregate; formal TOC verification via adopter interviews is required to close this criterion.

- [ ] **TOC verification of adopters.**

> **Status: Pending - linked to the above criterion.**

Will be closed together with the previous item once all planned interviews are complete and TOC confirms at least 3 independent production adopters across the graduation subprojects.

#### Adoption

> All 4 adopter interviews are complete and included below. CERN, DHL Data & AI, and NVIDIA are published with attribution; one additional interview is currently published in anonymized form pending explicit approval for named publication.

##### Adopter 1 - CERN/Scientific research organization

This adopter interview was conducted in June 2026 and recorded a strong production adopter running Kubeflow at scale across Notebooks, KServe, Trainer, Katib, and Pipelines, with plans to expand to thousands of users as part of a 3-5 year AI strategy. Refer to the [interview summary](adopter-interviews/kubeflow-adopter-interview-cern.md) for more details.

##### Adopter 2 - Financial services organization (anonymized)

This adopter interview was conducted in June 2026 with a large regulated financial services organization using Kubeflow extensively in production across multiple subprojects. Refer to the [interview summary](adopter-interviews/kubeflow-adopter-interview-adopter-1.md) for details.

##### Adopter 3 - DHL Data & AI / Logistics organization

This adopter interview was conducted in June 2026 with DHL Data & AI, operating Kubeflow in production at significant scale across Notebooks, Pipelines, Dashboard, and Spark Operator, with Katib, Trainer, and Hub on the near-term roadmap. Refer to the [interview summary](adopter-interviews/kubeflow-adopter-interview-dhl.md) for details.

##### Adopter 4 - NVIDIA / AI/ML platform organization

This adopter interview was conducted in June 2026 with NVIDIA Run:ai, using Kubeflow Trainer in production for large-scale distributed training. Refer to the [interview summary](adopter-interviews/kubeflow-adopter-interview-nvidia.md) for details.

- [X] **Clearly documented integrations and/or compatibility with other CNCF projects as well as non-CNCF projects.**

Kubeflow's integration documentation is organized per subproject (each has dedicated integration guides) rather than a single consolidated page. Maintainer confirmation (Andrey Velichkevich, 2026-06-17): "every Kubeflow subproject has its own list of integrations with other CNCF projects." An [Ecosystem page](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/ecosystem/) provides a top-level view of ecosystem partners.

Per-subproject integration evidence (verified 2026-06-17):
